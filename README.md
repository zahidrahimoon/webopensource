### Asset Optimization & Image Compression

Utilize tools like TinyPNG, ImageOptim or Squoosh to reduce image sizes before uploading (PNG, JPEG etc). Web image formats opt for modern like WebP to achieve smaller file sizes without sacrificing quality. Avoid excessively high-resolution images for most web projects - a resolution of 72 DPI is adequate for optimal performance. SVGs whenever possible for vector-based graphics as they are lightweight and scale seamlessly without losing quality. Compress files like PDFs and audio using lossless compression tools to minimize their size before adding to the repository.

### Code Performance Optimization

Tools like Webpack or Vite configure to combine and minify JavaScript and CSS files. This helps reduce file sizes and improves page load speed. When working with third-party libraries, import only required components to avoid including unused code. Such as import {Button} from 'library' instead of import * as Library from 'library'. These practices ensure projects remain lightweight, efficient, and ready for deployment while maintaining a good level of complexity and variation in sentence structure.
